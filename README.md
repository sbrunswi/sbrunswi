- 👋 Hi, I’m @sbrunswi
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, human-AI teaming, and robotics; recently I got really excited about two topics: Machine theory of mind and quantum-inspired RL, and PINNs; I love drones
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new things, always learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on areas like machine learning for system identification (including PINNs, etc.) with a focus on aerodynamics and propulsion; I am working on stuff on that
- 💞️ I'am recently also doing some work on LLM and alignment, and fine-tuning for safety critical scenarios of navigation and route planning; also love to get insights there..
- 📫 How to reach me sabine.brunswicker@gmail.com
