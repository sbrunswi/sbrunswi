- 👋 Hi, I’m @sbrunswi
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, computational social science, human-AI teaming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new things, always learning. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on data science challenges on www.ironhacks.com; I want to turn this into an OSS community.
- 💞️ I'am recently moving in autonomous system and UAVs; that is something super interesting as it is about control theory and AI/ML.
